/This application is a piece of ancient history; I worked on that circa 2004./

A simple 3D Solar System simulator, written using OpenGL. All orbital parameters (/not/ planet sizes
though) are based on real data I copied from an astronomy book. I used that project to get a top grade
on IT classes in secondary school.

Dumping the code here for the sake of history.
